# **Project Installation/Workflow Guides**

## **Overview of Project**
The motivation for the guides I share here goes back to the final group project
in the data science bootcamp I completed. We ran into the issue of working
across operating systems when sharing the project back and forth. That
experience led me down the path of learning how to work with programming
environments. During this learning, I created documentation for how I can set up
and install projects from two different perspectives: as the project creator and
as a collaborator. Additionally, there were many miscellaneous bits of
information that I had picked up related to workflows that I also decided to
gather in a markdown file. The link below is the result of this effort.

The guides can be found my portfolio's repo:

## **Community Participation**
When I started work on my portfolio, I decided to use `tailwind` CSS for
styling. I had wanted to install `tailwind` in my project as opposed to going
the CDN route. At this point, I already had these guides in the works and
decided to include instructions for how to add `tailwind` to a project.

Additional motivation for adding this content was that I did not find any
information on how to do add `tailwind` in the plotly `dash` community forum. I
wanted to capture what I had learned so into the guides this information went.

A few months later, I was on the plotly community forum and saw a question
related to adding `tailwind` to a `dash` app. Since I had the answer to this and
already had it documented, I decided to post a reply hoping that the guides
might help that person and others. Since the reply was attached to that specific
post, I thought that it might be hard for people to come across so I decided to
post my reply as a new thread in the "Plotly Dash show-and-tell" channel. Here
is a link to that post: [*plotly community post*](https://community.plotly.com/t/example-how-to-set-up-a-dash-app-with-tailwind-styling-using-the-tailwind-cli-as-opposed-to-the-cdn/77670)
A cool bonus was that I eventually earned a plotly community "Popular Link"
badge for over 50 clicks which is pretty neat!

My hope is that the guides serve as a demonstration of my understanding of the
importance of documentation. I also hope that this highlights a general quality
of thoroughness in my work.
