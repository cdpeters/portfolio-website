# **Project Installation and Workflow Guides**

## **Overview of Project**
The motivation for the guides shared here goes back to the final group project
in the data science bootcamp that I completed. We ran into issues working across
operating systems when sharing the project back and forth. That experience led
me down the path of learning how to work with python environments. During this
learning, I created documentation for how I can set up and install projects from
two different perspectives: as the project creator and as a collaborator.
Additionally, there were many miscellaneous bits of information that I had
picked up related to workflows that I also decided to gather in a markdown file.
The guides below are the result of this effort:

1. [*Data Project Installation Instructions*](https://github.com/cdpeters/portfolio-website/blob/main/notes/data_project_installation_instructions.md)
1. [*Data Project Workflows*](https://github.com/cdpeters/portfolio-website/blob/main/notes/data_project_workflows.md)

## **Community Participation**
When I started work on my portfolio, I decided to use tailwind CSS for
styling. I chose to attempt to install tailwind in my project as opposed to
going the CDN route. At this point, I already had these guides in the works and
decided to include instructions for how to add tailwind to a project once I
was able to figure out the steps.

Not being able to find any information on how to do add tailwind into a plotly
dash app on the plotly dash community forum also served as motivation for
including the tailwind instructions. I wanted to capture what I had learned so
that I wouldn't have to relearn the same steps at some point in the future.

A few months later, I was on the plotly community forum and saw a question
related to adding tailwind to a dash app. Since I had the answer to this and
already had it documented, I decided to post a reply hoping that the guides
might help that person and others. Not sure if people would see the reply, I
also created a new thread and posted that in the "Plotly Dash show-and-tell"
channel. Here is a link to that post: [*plotly community post*](https://community.plotly.com/t/example-how-to-set-up-a-dash-app-with-tailwind-styling-using-the-tailwind-cli-as-opposed-to-the-cdn/77670).
A cool bonus was that I eventually earned a plotly community "Popular Link"
badge for over 50 clicks which is pretty neat!

My hope is that the guides serve as a demonstration of my understanding of the
importance of documentation. I also hope that this highlights a general quality
of thoroughness in my work.
