# Sample

- This is a markdown element in Dash. All normal markdown features should work
  such as code snippets:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "col1": ["value1", "value2", "value3"],
        "col2": [1, 3, 9],
        "col3": [0.4, 2.6, -1.2],
    }
)
```

### Additional Example Section
1. Item 1 in a numbered list
    - This item has an unordered list
    - The unordered list has 2 items in it
1. Item 2 in a numbered list

<div align="center">

    />
</div>
This concludes the markdown example. Any experiments with markdown syntax can be
done on this page to see the output on the website.
