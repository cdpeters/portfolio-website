# **Dev Tool CLI**

## **Overview of Project**
[*tools.py*](https://github.com/cdpeters/portfolio-website/blob/main/tools.py)
runs the development tools on the current working directory (note that some of
the tools have the ability to recursively apply themselves down the directory
tree). The default behavior is to run these tools on jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)
only. CLI options allow for modifying this behavior to be able to run these
tools on python (.py) and markdown (.md) files as well. Additionally, there is
an option to allow for skipping tools during the run process if needed.
