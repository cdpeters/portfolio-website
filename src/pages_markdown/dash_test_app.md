# **Dash Test App**
A testing ground for Dash app development including app features and
experimenting with dashboard visualizations.

## **Install Project Locally**
Follow the instructions for a development role of **Collaborator**. See the
***Detailed Steps - Collaborator*** section in
[data_project_installation_instructions.md](https://github.com/cdpeters/dash-test-app/blob/main/notes/data_project_installation_instructions.md).
Note that there is also a ***High Level Steps - Collaborator*** section with an
overview of the steps needed to install the project.

## **Run App Locally**
Follow the instructions in section ***Dash App (Plotly Dash Website)*** in
[data_project_workflows.md](https://github.com/cdpeters/dash-test-app/blob/main/notes/data_project_workflows.md).

## **Requirements**
The project requires a python environment as defined by the combination of the
[environment.yml](https://github.com/cdpeters/dash-test-app/blob/main/environment.yml)
and
[pyproject.toml](https://github.com/cdpeters/dash-test-app/blob/main/pyproject.toml)
files (conda and poetry are not required to create the environment, use whatever
environment manager and package installer you prefer). The project also requires
node to be installed in order to install the javascript dependencies (for this
project just tailwindcss related ones).
